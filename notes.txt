Things that I've learned and have to keep in mind

- onClick={() => console.log('click')} not onClick={console.log('click')}
- lifting the state up
- state immutability is very important
- Array(9).fill(null)
- controlled components: Components w/o internal state and are fully controlled by the parent component.
- When we modified the Square to be a function component, we also changed onClick={() => this.props.onClick()} to a shorter onClick={props.onClick}
